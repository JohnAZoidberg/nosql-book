> A wide columnar store takes the idea of a key value store to the next level. Data is still distributed by a key, but the value is a structured set of rows and columns. This tabular payload allows for storage of more complex, structured data. Depending on the implementation, there may or may not be a strict schema applied to this payload.

> Wide columnar stores offer many of the semantics of relational databases but support the ability to distribute and scale the system.
